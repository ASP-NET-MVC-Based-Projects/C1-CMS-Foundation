					<!-- <h1>Boost your composite!</h1>  -->
					<p>You can optimize the performance of Composite C1 by installing <strong>WebRunner</strong>, a simplified browser designed to work exclusively with the Composite C1 web application. Highlights include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><span><strong>Fast performance:</strong> WebRunner is based on the Mozilla Gecko engine for superfast layout rendering. Pages load faster and the application consumes less memory.</span></li>
						<li><span><strong>Separate process: </strong> When multiple websites are opened in a standard browser, the system becomes slow and unresponsive. WebRunner is dedicated to <nobr>Composite C1</nobr> and remains unaffected by other web applications.</span></li>
						<li><span><strong>Desktop integration:</strong> Launch Composite C1 directly from your Windows Start Menu or Quick Launch Bar. With no browser functions to distract you, Composite C1 in WebRunner feels more like a desktop application than a website.</span></li>
						<li><span><strong>Developer friendly: </strong> Separating Composite C1 from the standard browser implies that you are free to turn off cache in the browser. This setting is desired for website development, but not recommended for Composite C1.</span></li>
					</ul>
					<h4>What is it?</h4>
					<p>WebRunner is a precursor to Mozilla's <a title="Read more about Prism" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Prism">Prism</a> technology scheduled for release this summer. The final version will perform at twice the speed, but already WebRunner provides a significant boost in performance compared to your current browser.</p>
					<h4>Is it safe?</h4>
					<p>WebRunner is locked to your Composite C1 website. It is not possible to view other pages on the internet using WebRunner, so there is no risk of getting infected by malicious websites.</p>
					<!-- 
					<h4>But I'm already using Firefox!</h4>
					<p>Then you are already using the Mozilla Gecko engine for fast rendering. But opening multiple tabs will stil affect <nobr>Composite C1</nobr>; and certain extensions are known to impact performance badly (specifically the Firebug extension is known to cause a slowdown). For developers, separating Composite C1 from the standard browser has the added benefit that you may turn off caching in the browser. This is desired for website development, but not recommended for Composite C1.</p>

					<h1>How to install</h1>
					<p>Download the <a href="javascript://" title="Download now!">WebRunner package</a> to a local folder and double-click the EXE file. This will install WebRunner and produce a <nobr>Composite C1</nobr> shortcut on your Desktop. The shortcut can then be dragged to the Quick Launch Bar.</p>
					<p>If you are managing more than one website, note that only a single copy of WebRunner gets installed on your machine by following this procedure a second time.</p>
